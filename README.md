# Squad_Management_System
This Project aims to provide a Database Management System for Cricket Authorities to manage squads for Franchise Cricket. This will contain a main pool of players and after a player is auctioned , he can be added to the particular team. This segregation of players can be made easy by using our Application. We will show all the statistics of the player and also we can view the current status of every team after each addition. We will have separate tables for Players in the pool and all the teams. Initially all the players would be present in the main pool.
